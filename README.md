## Product Vision Statement

To simplify shared financial experiences by turning the often stressful task of bill splitting into a seamless, positive experience.

## User Requirements

1. As a group member, I want a fun and fair way to decide who pays the bill, So that we can quickly and happily determine who covers the expense next
2. As the one who pays the bill, I want to ensure that everyone is reminded to settle their shares on time, so that dues are paid promptly without needing to personally remind anyone, avoiding discomfort.
3. As a diner in a group, I want an easy method to accurately split the tax and tips based on what each person owes, So that everyone pays their fair share without complex calculations.
4. As a user, I want to easily send and receive payments for shared expenses, So that settling up is quick and effortless, minimizing the need to navigate through multiple apps or platforms.
5. As a user, I want to be able to split specific items/amounts amongst different members so that the bill is split fairly.
6. As someone who travels, I want to split bills in multiple currencies, so that I can manage shared expenses with friends and family back home without currency conversion hassle.
7. As a user with a large social circle, I want to create and manage multiple groups for different events or friend circles, so that I can organize expenses separately and efficiently.
8. As a user, I want the app to calculate the most efficient way to settle debts within the group so that we can minimize the number of transactions.
9. As a group member, I want to see a clear breakdown of what I owe and what others owe me so that I can settle debts easily.
10. As a user who values simplicity, I want the app to offer a quick split option that divides expenses equally with a single tap, so that I can save time on calculations during casual gatherings.

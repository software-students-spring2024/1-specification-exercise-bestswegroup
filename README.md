## Stakeholders

Interview summaries (full interviews are available in the interviews.md file)
### Yunseo Kim
Yunseo doesn't fit our target demographic as splitting the bill isn't a "hair on fire" problem for him. He would not be a frequent user and would not gain much value from our proposed solution.

Goals
- Convenient methods to split the bill
- Minimal burden from solutions - not needing to bother others
- Getting paid back in an timely manner
- Getting paid back the full amount

Frustrations (minimal)
- Minimal pains
- Having to awkwardly remind friends
- Forgetting to follow up on pyaments
- Not getting reimbursed for small payments because it's not worth splitting

### Jason Lin
Jason fits our target demographic more as a frequent traveler.

Goals
- Send automatic notifications to ensure timely repayments, reducing the burden on the payer.
- Automate the division of bills, taxes, and tips based on what each person ordered, making the process quick and accurate.
- Directly integrate payment methods (i.e. Venmo/Zelle) to facilitate transfers without manually sharing payment information each time.
- Simplify Decision-Making: Provide a fun and impartial way to make quick decisions on who should pay, enhancing the dining experience.

Frustrations
- Payers often forget to pay, leading to uncomfortable reminders and potential conflicts.
- Calculating how much each person owes, including their share of taxes and tips, can be complicated and error-prone.
- Transferring money can be cumbersome if payers use different payment methods or payment details aren't readily available.
- Deciding who should pay the bill can be awkward.


## Product Vision Statement

To simplify shared financial experiences by turning the often stressful task of bill splitting into a seamless, positive experience.

8. As a user, I want the app to calculate the most efficient way to settle debts within the group so that we can minimize the number of transactions.

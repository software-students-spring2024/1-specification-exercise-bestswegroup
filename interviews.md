# Yunseo Kim Interview
## General Experience
- Can you describe a recent situation where you needed to split a bill or expense with others? What was the context?

     About two weeks ago my friends and I (as a group of six) went to a restaurant where we split the bill based on which dishes we ate 

- How often do you find yourself needing to split expenses with others, and in what contexts (e.g., dining out, shared housing expenses, group travel)?
   
     I often find myself sharing the bill when eating out with others or very occasionally when we travel and pay our share; this is usually split evenly since its too much work to decide "who ate more expensive dishes" etc., individually paying for personal items (like gifts/souvenirs) 

- Describe any difficulties you’ve faced when splitting bills or expenses manually or using technology.

     Never, I just use mental math and/or a calculator when deciding who has to pay which amount
     (Cost of individual dishes) + (cost of shared dishes) ÷ a + (tax and tip) ÷ n
     Splitting bills in this manner is typically no issue if everyone just uses venmo/zelle to send money. 
     However, this was annoying when we didnt use these apps at a younger age and had to split using cash: if everyone brought a $20 bill but had to pay $15 for example we wouldnt be able to split. At that point, we used to ask the server to split the 20 or just pay the person at a later date, when we had the proper bills. 

- Have you ever been in a situation where someone did not pay their share on time? How did you handle it?

     Probably have never felt much frustration to these situations, since the money splitting is usually done between close friends and so if someone doesnt pay immediately, I personally believe theyll pay it back eventually as long as they are asked to do so (or there will be a time in the future where they will pay for me). 

- How do you currently remind others to pay their share, and how effective do you find this method?

     ex: @fred reminder to give 25 dolar for bowling > works pretty well tbh 

- Splitting tip/tax is not a big deal. I'm not gonna split a 15 dollar tip btwn 5 people differently than just 3 3 3 3 3 as opposed to 2.5 2 3.5 3 4. I mean if you have someone that REALLY wants to save the 50 cents. But esp btwn close friends i think its rlly negligible. But again this is for a discussion of tax and tip which are relatively lower values.
## Potential Improvements
- Not an issue? Maybe im too boomer but idk how an app would make the process easier or faster. My brain and a calculator does the job.
- How important is it for you to track your expenses and payments over time?

     If its marginal amounts like $20 for a meal and smth btwn close friends dont think we strangle eachother for money (unless we're running low on money ofc). If both parties forget it probably wasnt a huge amount of money to cause any issues in the first place 
     For larger payments though I think its def important to track them and pay them as quickly as possible (whenever convenient) just to get it off both parties' shoulders.
